#  Perspective Crop Layers (PCL) â€“ This repository makes code modular and working for higher environment dependecies

This is repositroy is from the original [Perspective Crop Layers (PCL)](https://github.com/yu-frank/PerspectiveCropLayers) repository introduces a modular, scalable, and maintainable design for handling multiple human pose estimation datasets, including Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

## ðŸš€ Python 3.9 Compatibility and Dependency Fixes

The original repository was written for **Python 3.6** and uses outdated libraries (e.g. `torch._six`). To ensure reproducibility and compatibility with modern systems:

- Migrated codebase to **Python 3.9**
- Rebuilt all requirements in `new_req.txt`
- Updated deprecated/removed modules

### Fix for `torch._six` Removal

One key fix applied is the replacement of deprecated imports in `margipose/data/__init__.py`:

```diff
- from torch._six import string_classes, int_classes
+ string_classes = (str,)
+ int_classes = (int,)
```
## Perspective Crop Layers â€“ Modular Refactor

###  Key Improvements

#### 1. `config_data.py`: Unified Dataset Configuration

We introduced a new module `config_data.py` to handle all dataset-specific configurations, making it easy to plug in additional datasets or update parameters without modifying the main pipeline.

##### Features:
- Canonical skeleton conversion
- Access to mean/std for both 2D and 3D normalization
- Dynamic switching between STN (rectangular crop) and PCL (virtual camera crop) statistics
- Extensible for additional datasets

##### Example:
```python
from config_data import get_dataset_config

dataset_config = get_dataset_config("H36m")
mean_3d = dataset_config.get_joint_mean()
std_2d, mean_2d = dataset_config.get_2d_mean_std(slant=True, stn=False)
canonical_pose = dataset_config.to_canonical(pose_2d)
